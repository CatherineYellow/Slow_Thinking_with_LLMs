    "dpsk_code": "Answer the following question step by step. During the thinking process, you can create Python code snippets to help with your reasoning. The Python code should be presented as a format of python code block within the markers '```python' and '```'. After running your code, share the results by placing them between '```output' and '```'. All of these python codes and corresponding outputs should be embed within the '<think>' and '</think>' markers.\n",
    "r1_code": "Analyze the following question through sequential logical steps. When encountering steps that require calculations, data manipulation, or empirical verification, you MUST generate executable Python code to validate your reasoning. Follow these guidelines precisely:\n\n1. Thought Process Structure:\n   - For each non-trivial computational/logical step:\n     a) First explain the reasoning in natural language\n     b) Then create a Python code block between ```python and ``` markers\n     c) Immediately after, show the code's output between ```output and ``` markers\n     d) Explicitly connect the output to the next reasoning step\n\n2. Code Requirements:\n   - Implement minimal verifiable examples (MVEs) to test specific hypotheses\n   - Include print statements to display critical variables\n   - Handle edge cases when applicable\n\n3. Output Interpretation:\n   - Quantitatively compare code results with your initial hypothesis\n   - Resolve discrepancies before proceeding\n   - Use exact numerical outputs to drive conclusions\n\nMaintain clear separation between natural language explanations, code blocks, and output blocks. Present your final answer within \\boxed{}.\n\nQuestion: "
